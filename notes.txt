Ideal way to start a react app is using create-react-app with
We can write the code even without using any package 
but that would not be optimal
crate-react-app sets up a basic react app
while installing create-react-app we do not use npm but we use npx(use a package without downloading)
npx-->use create react app once and then it is gone
npm-->downloading create-react-app
::::installing create-react-app::::::::::::::::
npx create-react-app name_of_application
and a folder will be created
REACT is a library not a framework
REACT app--> uses component architecture
if you use npx create-react-app .
then all the files wil open up instead of creating a folder
WARN -- there might be some problem but works fine
 
 your react components will be added in the src folder and in those components you will send props and components will have a state

Props : e.g  there is a form and in the form i put name,age,.... then the form is a component then the details i put inside the form are the props, as i send this form with my props i.e details ke saath form ko bharunga to ye form mera form hoga.

state : e.g there is this form(component) and and it has a heading . then the heading is part of the state .
We will be mainly working in src 
Do not touch the index.html in public. All the rendering will be done in this index.html and with the help of js we will popul ate the root div

I src:
-->App.js is a component
-->index.js is our entry point:telling to render the app component and after rendering take its content to div....

so whatever changes we make in App.js, with the help of index.js it will all go to the root div

to start the react app - - > npm start
for production  - - > npm run build

All components are in src

components in react are : 
1)Function based components
2)Class based components

first create-react-app used to ue class based components, now it uses function based components.

TextForm::::::::::::::::

// useState hook required from react
//useState is a hook --> use state and other React components without writing class (for function based components)--> helps use features of a class without making a class


//text is a variable and whenever I will update text it will be through the setText function
// Enter text here is the default value of text
//wherever I will use text and whenever I will update it, it will  get updated at all those places(without reloading the page)
//array destructuring 
//useState will return an array 
//cant update state like a normal variable, have to use updation function for ir
//text set(state) to --> first parameter of the returned array
//setText(updation function) set to --> second parameter of the returned array


/react does not watch all the  variables by default, it only watches the state variables
